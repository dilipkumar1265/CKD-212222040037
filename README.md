## Kideny Stone Detection Using Deep Learning

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient deep learning model to assist in the automated  kidney Stone Detection.

## About

This project focuses on To Predicte Stone on kidney CT scan images using a deep learning model based on the VGG16 architecture. By leveraging transfer learning from the pre-trained VGG16 model, we aim to enhance feature extraction from the images and improve the model's accuracy.The dataset used in this project comprises CT images categorized into the four aforementioned classes. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, with careful data preprocessing and augmentation to ensure high accuracy and generalization on unseen data.
