## Title of the Project
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

The development of a machine learning model for the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), utilizing clinical data and medical images. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying CKD at an early stage, enabling timely interventions, improving patient outcomes, and streamlining diagnosis processes.

## About
The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Detection Model is a project aimed at leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to assist in the early identification and diagnosis of CKD. Chronic Kidney Disease is a progressive condition that often goes undetected until it reaches advanced stages, making timely intervention critical. This project addresses the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by developing a predictive model using clinical data and medical imaging. The system offers healthcare providers a faster, more reliable tool to assess CKD risk, enabling early treatment and improving patient outcomes. Through this solution, the diagnostic process is streamlined, reducing the need for extensive manual evaluation and enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery.
